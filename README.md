# MiniGNU

MiniGNU is a project study on operating systems, where I create a minimal Linux distribution using the Linux-libre kernel and BusyBox.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to better understand the internal workings of operating systems by exploring the creation of a minimalist Linux distribution.

## Tools Used

- **Linux-libre Kernel:** A version of the Linux kernel that removes proprietary components.
- **BusyBox:** A suite of Unix utilities in a single executable, ideal for systems with limited resources.
